# Writing - Can we write in general?
Language and communication are by far the most important things in human society today, most commonly associated with reading and writing. These two abilities - reading and writing - are nearly the same, as by the time that we begin to learn how to read, we are also made to learn how to write, and it makes sense as to why. Writing is an essential part of human society, culture, literature, and many other subjects. Even now you are reading something that has been written – albeit electronically. But what does it mean to write? Is there a way to truly master writing? Can we even write about anything without purpose?  
## Enter, Elizabeth Wardle

Elizabeth Wardle does not seem to think we can. In her short article "You Can Learn to Write in General", Wardle emphasizes to all writers how everything that is written has purpose, and it can never be boiled down to just "writing in general". She gives a multitude of examples to justify her claim, from biologists with research papers to college students with their teachers and even fanfiction writers with their fans. Each of these writers cannot just "write in general", because if they do they will never be able to fulfill their own needs, whether to prove a theory, or to pass a class, or even to please a certain online fan-base. Her examples show that every writer has a purpose to fulfill in their specific situation, reiterating how odd the concept of writing in general really is. In essence, Wardle states that one's life landscape shapes both why they write and how they write, and because of the ever changing nature of one's landscape, the process of learning how to write is never-ending. There is no secret formula to writing, no easy path to successful literature, there is only failure and perseverance in the pursuit of great writing. As she says, "There is no writing inoculation, because there is no such thing as writing in general...it gives all writers permission to keep learning, to fail, and to engage in new kinds of writing in new situations". This is a central concept in her overarching message.  
## It ain't so easy this day in age
Wardle has a clear and concise idea of what writing is, but I have personally never thought about what it means to write. For me, writing has really only been a tool to get through school with. In the past, whenever I had to write something, I was always thinking about it in a very organized and structured way, such as what subjects I am writing for, how formal I should be, and how the argument should be presented, among other things. Even now I am thinking about all of these concepts and more to write this essay. In a sense, the way I have written before embodies Wardle’s idea that there is no way to write without purpose, but ignores her idea that there is no true structure in writing.  
For those of you who are beginning the college admissions process, this concept should be especially important to you guys, since you are going to soon be writing college essays for you admissions process. This was a particularly tricky thing for me to do. I do not think that the way I wrote before is particularly bad, but I would say it is not exactly very expressive. The inexpressiveness of my writing style was most noticeable during my college application process. The college application process was, frankly, quite tedious and annoying, but overall simple. The worst of it came when colleges asked me -in a more formal way- a very simple question, “Tell us about yourself”. I am not someone who likes to talk about themselves in writing to begin with, but to write about myself for an application process is blasphemy at its finest. Overall the essays were quite short in length, but they were probably the most grueling essays I have ever had to write. I didn’t know how formal I should be, what I should really talk about, but most importantly, how to express myself in my writing, to really tell the college who I am as an individual. Needless to say, I didn’t get into some colleges. 
In the past, I thought of writing only as something to help me in school, but I think that now, writing is much more than that. Writing is used as an expression of both one’s beliefs and one’s self. It is ultimately writing that helps humans understand each other at all times. Without expression or personality in writing, it essentially takes on a lifeless form resembling a machine. For example, I used to not see my previous writing style as a structure to be used over and over again, but after the college admissions process, I realized that expression of oneself is the ultimate factor of standing out above the rest in a sea of writing automations. Like Wardle states, there is no surefire structure in writing, as it is this structureless writing that allows us to empathize and understand one another. Ultimately, form is not an indicator of the message, it is the personality of the writer that makes a message what it is.

## Still, writing is definitely important

My conception of writing is, at its core, tied to Wardle’s own writing conception. To explain Wardle's conception in layman's terms, she answers the general question of why we write, and thus her idea has a place in many other conceptions of writing. In essence, her conception is the basis with which all other ideas of writing are built upon. The main similarity between our ideas is that there is always a purpose to why we write. As she states, "There is no writing in general, and thus no single class or workshop or experience can teach people to write. once and for all", which coincides with my conception that writing is primarily for someone to express themselves. My conception only indirectly touches on this idea though, as it is primarily focused on what writing allows us to do. As a whole, although Wardle's thoughts on writing have a place in my conception, she talks about why we write and what things drive us to write, "They tell us that every new situation, audience, and purpose requires writers to learn to do and understand new possibilities and constraints for their writing".  For me though, writing is ultimately what makes us human.
